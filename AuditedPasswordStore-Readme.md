**Description of the Enhanced PasswordStore Contract**  

This improved version of the `PasswordStore` contract incorporates critical security measures, optimizations, and functional enhancements to ensure robust and secure password management.  

### **Key Features**:  
1. **Owner-Only Access Control**:  
   - Both `setPassword` and `getPassword` functions are restricted to the contract owner, ensuring unauthorized users cannot modify or access the password.  
   - Unauthorized attempts trigger a custom error, `PasswordStore__NotOwner`, for efficient error handling.  

2. **Secure Password Storage**:  
   - Passwords are securely hashed using the Keccak256 hashing algorithm before being stored on-chain. This prevents plaintext password exposure, even through blockchain explorers.  

3. **Event Logging**:  
   - A descriptive `PasswordUpdated` event logs the owner's address and the hashed password whenever a new password is set, improving contract transparency and traceability.  

4. **Ownership Transfer Capability**:  
   - A `transferOwnership` function allows the current owner to transfer contract ownership to another address, enhancing flexibility and usability.  

5. **Gas Optimization**:  
   - Storage variables are optimized to reduce gas consumption, with hashed passwords stored as `bytes32` instead of `string`.  

6. **Improved Documentation**:  
   - Function descriptions have been updated for accuracy and clarity, eliminating redundant or misleading information.  

### **Enhanced Security and Usability**:  
This updated version resolves prior issues with unrestricted access, plaintext password storage, and missing functionality. It ensures that sensitive data remains private and accessible only to authorized users while maintaining operational transparency.  

The contract is now a secure and efficient solution for password storage and management, suitable for real-world use cases.
